#  	Central Message Router

This project is base on the system created by Bachuey.

You can find the original files with this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZIN-RRjm0

I've add some features :

    * ServerAdminCommand, only from allowed Client, like "exit" or "activelog"
    * ServerCommand : like "List" and "register"
    * Client can only send command if they are registered
    * adding custom ServerCommand or ServerAdminCommand without modifing the main script : "onthefly"
    * Colored log

Planned Features:

    * use the same system "onthefly" for the client part.

Ideas not planned yet :

    * Installer for the Server, from the web
    * Installer for the client, from the network (server)
