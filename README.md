# Minecraft-OpenComputer
contains all projet for Open Computers

## Central Message Router

This project is base on the system created by Bachuey.

You can find the original files with this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZIN-RRjm0

I've add some features :

* ServerAdminCommand, only from allowed Client, like "exit" or "activelog"
* ServerCommand : like "List" and "register"
* Client can only send command if they are registered
* adding custom ServerCommand or ServerAdminCommand without modifing the main script : "onthefly"
* Colored log

Planned Features:

* use the same system "onthefly" for the client part.

Ideas not planned yet :

* Installer for the Server, from the web
* Installer for the client, from the network (server)

## Mekanism Induction Matrix Monitor

Early stage of the developpement.

The induction matrix has a bug () so the input cannot be read.

this put the project on hold.

Maybe working on the UI

Base on this script : https://oc.cil.li/index.php?/topic/915-histograms-used-in-power-monitoring/
